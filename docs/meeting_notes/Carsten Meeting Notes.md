# Meeting Notes With Carsten
## <2026-2-19> Notes from meeting with Carsten Re: Salp PCB

## Notes on trace width:
- for calculating minimum trace width that is a function of copper thickness, allowable temperature rise, acceptable power loss, etc

- Note that the acceptable power loss appears to be the limiting factor more than allowable temperature rise in this case.
