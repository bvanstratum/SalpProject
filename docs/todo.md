## Brian's Todo Items
- [x] find old tutorial that shows making custom fat solder pads (Brian) see Phil's Lab video below

## Carsten's Todo Items:
- [ ] add the ~1 in by ~2 in (check notes for exact dimensions) PCB edge to the board layout
- [ ] drag, flip, rotate, etc to minimize signal crossings
- [ ] Route 20 mil for signal traces 
- [ ] Route 40 mil for power traces (Anything connecting the battery)
- [ ] either edit board footprint or change part to match jst-sh 6 pin connectors we have in the lab
- [ ] loop back and check on the via's under the board for the battery connections
